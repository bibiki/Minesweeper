What this is
============

This is a command line based minesweeper game. It has these commands: new, show, opentile, marktile.

The new command game generates a new minesweeper game.

The show command shows the current state of the game.

The opentile open a particular cell on the minesweeper grid. Its usage is as follows ```minesweeper opentile row col``` where row and col are number identifying the particular cell on the grid to be opened. The values for row and col range between 0 and 99 inclusive.

The marktile command is not implemented but was envisioned as a utility to mark a cell on the grid when player believes it to be a mine.
